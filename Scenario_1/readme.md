# Make changes in a feature branch and merge them to master

This exercise reflects the best-case scenario, where you (an engineer) pull code down from Git, make some changes in feature branch, and push them up to to Git, and merge with remote origin with no additional changes made by other engineers, and does not cause any merge conflicts. 

What is a feature branch?

[A feature branch is simply a separate branch in your Git repo used to implement a single feature in your project.](https://bocoup.com/blog/git-workflow-walkthrough-feature-branches)

# Instructions
1. On your local machine, create a new branch called `scenario1`.
    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b scenario1
    ```
    </details>

1. In the `scenario1` branch, modify FileToModify.txt using a text editor of your choice so that it looks like the End Result outlined below. 
1. Stage changes (on your local machine)
    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    
    ```console 
    $ git stage -A
    ```
    </details>
1. Commit changes
    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    
    ```console 
    $ git commit -m "your message"
    ```
    </details>
1. Push changes from your current local `scenario1` branch to remote `my-fork`
    ```console
    $ git push -u my-fork scenario1
    ```
1. Open a Pull Request (PR) on the Github website to merge your changes with origin. 
    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    
    1. Go to `your-fork` (where you pushed your changes) on the Github website. By deafult, this is located at [github.intuit.com/<your-name>/git-practice](github.intuit.com/<your-name>/git-practice).
    1. Click "open a pull request" from
    </details>

# End Result
Afterwards, `FileToModify.txt` should look like the following in origin/master:
```
Line 1 
Line 2
Line 3 - Added by you
```
